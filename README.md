# Revend project


To use Gulp you need to have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

Install the dependencies by running:
```bash
$ npm install
```
This creates `node_modules` directory with all the plugins in the root of project.

Run the gulp command in your project directory:
```bash
$ gulp
```

Navigate to `localhost:3000` in browser and you should see `pages/index.html` open, as the server runs in the background.
